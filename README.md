# Efficient computation of counterfactual explanations of LVQ models

This repository contains the implementation of the methods proposed in the paper [Efficient computation of counterfactual explanations of LVQ models](paper.pdf) by Andr√© Artelt and Barbara Hammer.

The methods are implemented in `counterfactuals_lvq.py`. A minimalistic usage example is given in [test.py](test.py).

The default solver is [SCS](https://github.com/cvxgrp/scs). If you want to use a different solver, you have to overwrite the `_solve` method.
